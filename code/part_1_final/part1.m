%% Part 1 Introduction
% The first objective of part one was to solve for the voltage map when 
% V = 1 Volt at x=0 and V = 0 volts at x = L. The top and bottom boundary 
% conditions where set so that dV/dy = 0.The second objective of part one
% was to solve for the voltage map when V = 1 volt at x=0, x=L and V= 0 
% volts at y =0, y =W. The numerical solution was than was than compared 
% with the analytical series solution so determine to what extent they 
% agree with each other.
